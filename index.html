									Rihanna apparently wants to "cut ties" with her LA home.<br>
									The star's Pacific Palisades mansion has been targeted by intruders and was allegedly invaded twice since the end of September.
									A removals firm has packed up her belongings as she performs her Diamonds World Tour in South Africa and Rihanna is reportedly wary about returning to the house.<br><br>
									"Even though she wasn't there when it happened, she doesn't feel safe in the house anymore," a source admitted to British magazine Star.<br>
									"Rihanna is really scared. She'd rather just cut ties with the house and move on."

								Scherzinger 'confused by ex'  - 17 Nov 2013
							</article>
							<section class="info_box">
								<article class="musicnews_info">
									Nicole Scherzinger is apparently frustrated with Lewis Hamilton "blowing hot and cold".<br/><br/>
									The former Pussycat Doll and the Formula One star started dating in 2007, but broke up and reunited several times before calling things off for good in July this year.<br/>
									Since then they've been spotted meeting up for "crisis talks" and it was recently reported Lewis promised Nicole children if she takes him back.<br/>
									Now it seems the sports star has changed his mind about getting back together, leaving the 35-year-old in a confusing position.<br/>
